# Donnan Effects in Membrane Separation Processes

## Introduction to Donnan Equilibrium

The Donnan effect, first described by Frederick George Donnan in 1911, is a fundamental electrochemical phenomenon that occurs when a charged membrane separates two solutions containing electrolytes. This effect plays a crucial role in ultrafiltration and diafiltration processes, particularly when dealing with charged proteins, polyelectrolytes, and ionic solutions.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Basic Donnan Theory
The Donnan equilibrium establishes when the electrochemical potential of diffusible ions is equal on both sides of a semi-permeable membrane. For a membrane permeable to small ions but impermeable to large charged species (like proteins), the equilibrium condition is:

```
μᵢ¹ = μᵢ²
```

Where μᵢ¹ and μᵢ² are the electrochemical potentials of ion i on sides 1 and 2 of the membrane.

### Donnan Potential
The electrical potential difference across the membrane at equilibrium:

```
ΔΨ = (RT/zF) × ln(aᵢ²/aᵢ¹)
```

Where:
- R = gas constant
- T = temperature
- z = ion charge
- F = Faraday constant
- aᵢ = ion activity

### Ion Distribution
For a simple case with monovalent salt (NaCl) and polyelectrolyte (protein):

```
[Na⁺]₁ × [Cl⁻]₁ = [Na⁺]₂ × [Cl⁻]₂
```

The electroneutrality condition must be satisfied on both sides:
- Side 1: [Na⁺]₁ = [Cl⁻]₁ + [Protein⁻]₁
- Side 2: [Na⁺]₂ = [Cl⁻]₂

## Donnan Effects in Ultrafiltration

### Protein Retention Enhancement
The Donnan effect can significantly enhance protein retention beyond what would be expected from size exclusion alone:

1. **Electrostatic repulsion**: Negatively charged proteins experience additional repulsion from negatively charged membrane surfaces
2. **Co-ion exclusion**: Proteins carrying the same charge as the membrane are more effectively retained
3. **Charge shielding**: High ionic strength reduces Donnan effects by charge screening

### Salt Passage Modification
Donnan effects influence the passage of salts through ultrafiltration membranes:
- **Enhanced passage**: Salts may pass more readily to maintain electroneutrality
- **Selective permeation**: Different ions may have different transmission rates
- **Concentration polarization**: Ionic accumulation near membrane surface

### pH Effects
The pH of the solution significantly impacts Donnan behavior:
- **Protein charge state**: pH relative to isoelectric point determines protein charge
- **Membrane charge**: pH affects ionization of membrane functional groups
- **Buffer ion distribution**: Different buffer species exhibit varying Donnan behavior

## Practical Implications in UFDF Processes

### Buffer Selection
Careful selection of buffer systems to optimize Donnan effects:

1. **Ionic strength considerations**: Higher ionic strength reduces Donnan effects
2. **Buffer ion size**: Large buffer ions may not cross membrane, affecting equilibrium
3. **pH buffering capacity**: Maintaining pH during Donnan redistribution
4. **Compatibility**: Buffer compatibility with product and membrane

### Process Optimization
Leveraging Donnan effects for improved separation:
- **pH control**: Adjusting pH to optimize protein charge state
- **Ionic strength manipulation**: Using salt gradients to control Donnan effects
- **Membrane selection**: Choosing membranes with appropriate charge characteristics
- **Operating conditions**: Optimizing pressure and flow to minimize unwanted effects

### Yield Optimization
Understanding Donnan effects helps maximize product yield:
- **Protein losses**: Minimizing protein losses due to unexpected permeation
- **Concentration factors**: Achieving higher concentration factors through charge effects
- **Selectivity enhancement**: Improving separation of similarly sized but differently charged species

## Quantitative Analysis

### Donnan Coefficient
The Donnan coefficient (r) quantifies the degree of ion exclusion:

```
r = [ion]permeate / [ion]feed
```

For ideal Donnan behavior with monovalent ions and a polyelectrolyte:

```
r = 1 / (1 + Cp×z²p / (2×Cs))
```

Where:
- Cp = polyelectrolyte concentration
- zp = polyelectrolyte charge per molecule
- Cs = salt concentration

### Osmotic Pressure Contribution
Donnan effects contribute to osmotic pressure across the membrane:

```
Δπ_Donnan = RT × Σ(Δcᵢ)
```

Where Δcᵢ is the concentration difference of ion i across the membrane.

### Membrane Potential Measurement
Experimental determination of Donnan potential:
- **Direct measurement**: Using reference electrodes on both sides
- **Streaming potential**: Measuring potential during flow
- **Membrane potential**: Equilibrium potential measurement
