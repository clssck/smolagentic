# Diafiltration Processes and Applications

## Introduction to Diafiltration

Diafiltration (DF) is an enhanced ultrafiltration process that combines membrane filtration with continuous addition of fresh solvent or buffer to achieve superior separation performance. This technique enables simultaneous concentration and purification by washing retained species while removing permeating impurities more effectively than simple ultrafiltration.

## Fundamental Principles

### Process Mechanism
Diafiltration operates by continuously adding fresh diafiltration medium (typically buffer or water) to the retentate while maintaining constant volume through permeate removal. This creates a washing effect that enhances the removal of small molecules while retaining larger species.

### Mathematical Description
The concentration of permeating species during diafiltration follows exponential decay:

```
C(t) = C₀ × exp(-V_p/V_r)
```

Where:
- C(t) = concentration at time t
- C₀ = initial concentration
- V_p = cumulative permeate volume
- V_r = retentate volume

### Diafiltration Volumes
The efficiency of diafiltration is typically expressed in diafiltration volumes (DV):

```
DV = V_permeate / V_initial_retentate
```

Complete removal of small molecules typically requires 3-5 diafiltration volumes.

## Types of Diafiltration

### Constant Volume Diafiltration (CVD)
In CVD, the retentate volume remains constant throughout the process:
- **Fresh buffer addition**: Continuous or batch-wise addition of diafiltration medium
- **Permeate removal**: Equal volume of permeate removed to maintain constant volume
- **Applications**: Desalting, buffer exchange, removal of reaction by-products

### Variable Volume Diafiltration (VVD)
VVD allows retentate volume to change during the process:
- **Concentration phase**: Initial concentration without buffer addition
- **Diafiltration phase**: Buffer addition with continued concentration
- **Applications**: Combined concentration and purification in single step

### Discontinuous Diafiltration
Batch-wise process with alternating concentration and dilution steps:
- **Dilution**: Addition of fresh buffer to increase volume
- **Concentration**: Removal of permeate to reduce volume
- **Applications**: Gentle processing of shear-sensitive materials

## Operating Modes

### Fed-Batch Diafiltration
Intermittent addition of diafiltration medium:
- **Batch addition**: Discrete volumes of buffer added at intervals
