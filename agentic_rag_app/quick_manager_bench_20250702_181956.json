Facts survey\\nYou will build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need.\\nThese \"facts\" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings:\\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task\\nList here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).\\n\\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\\nList here any facts that we may need to look up.\\nAlso list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.\\n\\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\\nList here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.\\n\\nDon\\'t make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Do not add anything else on top of three headings above.\\n\\n## 2. Plan\\nThen for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.\\nAfter writing the final step of the plan, write the \\'<end_plan>\\' tag and stop there.\\n\\nYou can leverage these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n```python\\ndef simple_chat(message: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"Handle simple questions, greetings, basic math, and direct responses\\n\\n    Args:\\n        message: Simple message or question to respond to\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works similarly to calling a tool: provide the task description as the \\'task\\' argument. Since this team member is a real human, be as detailed and verbose as necessary in your task description.\\nYou can also include any relevant variables or context using the \\'additional_args\\' argument.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n```python\\ndef research_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Agent specialized in web search and current information research\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef rag_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Agent specialized in knowledge base search and complex reasoning\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\n\\n---\\nNow begin!

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n```python\\ndef simple_chat(message: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"Handle simple questions, greetings, basic math, and direct responses\\n\\n    Args:\\n        message: Simple message or question to respond to\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works similarly to calling a tool: provide the task description as the \\'task\\' argument. Since this team member is a real human, be as detailed and verbose as necessary in your task description.\\nYou can also include any relevant variables or context using the \\'additional_args\\' argument.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n```python\\ndef research_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Agent specialized in web search and current information research\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef rag_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Agent specialized in knowledge base search and complex reasoning\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n5. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n9. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!'}], tool_calls=None, raw=None, token_usage=None), ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.USER: 'user'>, content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'New task:\\nHello!'}], tool_calls=None, raw=None, token_usage=None), ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.ASSISTANT: 'assistant'>, content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Here are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n<think>\\nOkay, let\\'s tackle this task.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.

Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n7.

You will need to 1. build a survey of facts known or needed to solve the task, then 2. make a plan of action to solve the task.\\n\\n## 1. Facts survey\\nYou will build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need.\\nThese \"facts\" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings:\\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task\\nList here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).\\n\\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\\nList here any facts that we may need to look up.\\nAlso list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.\\n\\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\\nList here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.\\n\\nDon\\'t make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Do not add anything else on top of three headings above.\\n\\n## 2. Plan\\nThen for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.\\nThis plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.\\nDo not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.\\nAfter writing the final step of the plan, write the \\'<end_plan>\\' tag and stop there.\\n\\nYou can leverage these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n```python\\ndef simple_chat(message: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"Handle simple questions, greetings, basic math, and direct responses\\n\\n    Args:\\n        message: Simple message or question to respond to\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works similarly to calling a tool: provide the task description as the \\'task\\' argument. Since this team member is a real human, be as detailed and verbose as necessary in your task description.\\nYou can also include any relevant variables or context using the \\'additional_args\\' argument.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n```python\\ndef research_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Agent specialized in web search and current information research\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef rag_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Agent specialized in knowledge base search and complex reasoning\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\n\\n---\\nNow begin!

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n```python\\ndef simple_chat(message: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"Handle simple questions, greetings, basic math, and direct responses\\n\\n    Args:\\n        message: Simple message or question to respond to\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works similarly to calling a tool: provide the task description as the \\'task\\' argument. Since this team member is a real human, be as detailed and verbose as necessary in your task description.\\nYou can also include any relevant variables or context using the \\'additional_args\\' argument.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n```python\\ndef research_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Agent specialized in web search and current information research\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef rag_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Agent specialized in knowledge base search and complex reasoning\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n5. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n9. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!'}], tool_calls=None, raw=None, token_usage=None), ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.USER: 'user'>, content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'New task:\\nGood morning'}], tool_calls=None, raw=None, token_usage=None), ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.ASSISTANT: 'assistant'>, content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Here are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n<think>\\nOkay, the user sent \"Good morning\".

The user isn\\'t asking for anything that requires research or data retrieval. So 1.2 is also empty.\\n\\nThen, facts to derive. The only thing here is recognizing that the message is a greeting. From that, I can derive the appropriate response, like responding with a greeting and offering assistance. But since the tools available include simple_chat, which handles basic responses, I can use that.\\n\\nNow, the plan. The user said \"Good morning\", so the response should be friendly. The simple_chat function is designed for handling simple messages and greetings. So the plan is to call simple_chat with the message \"Good morning\". That should generate an appropriate reply. Then, since there\\'s no further task, the final answer would be the response from simple_chat. Wait, but the user didn\\'t ask a question. Maybe the task is just to respond appropriately. So the plan is to use simple_chat to generate a response and then present that as the final answer. Let me check the tools again. The simple_chat function returns a string, which can be passed to final_answer. So the steps are: use simple_chat with the input message, then output the result.

So maybe \nthe user is referring to documents within a specific system, website, or        \ndatabase. But without more info, it's hard to tell.                             \n\nNext, Facts to Look Up: Since the user hasn't specified a particular source, I  \nneed to ask for clarification. Are they referring to public documents, company  \nfiles, academic papers, or something else? Also, if there's a specific website  \nor database they're interested in, I need to know that. Maybe they want me to   \nsearch the web for available documents, but that's a different approach than    \nchecking a local system.                                                        \n\nFacts to Derive: Without knowing the exact source or type of documents, I can't \nderive anything yet. The answer depends on where to look and what kind of       \ndocuments they need. So the next step is to ask the user for more details.      \n\nIn the Plan, I should outline steps to clarify the user's request. First, ask   \nthem to specify the context or source of the documents. Then, based on their    \nresponse, decide whether to use the research agent for web searches or the RAG  \nagent for knowledge base queries. If they provide a specific location, like a   \nwebsite or database, I can proceed accordingly. Otherwise, I can't move forward \nwithout more information.                                                       \n\n\nSo the main action here is to request clarification from the user. That's the   \nonly way to proceed because the current question is too vague. I can't assume   \nthey mean public documents or a specific site. Each possibility requires a      \ndifferent approach, so getting more details is essential.                       \n\n                          1.1.

The user is asking, \"What documents are \navailable?\" So I need to figure out what they mean by \"documents\" and how to \napproach this.\n\nFirst, under Facts Given in the Task: The task itself is just the question \"What\ndocuments are available?\" There's no additional context provided here. So maybe \nthe user is referring to documents within a specific system, website, or \ndatabase. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nNext, Facts to Look Up: Since the user hasn't specified a particular source, I \nneed to ask for clarification. Are they referring to public documents, company \nfiles, academic papers, or something else? Also, if there's a specific website \nor database they're interested in, I need to know that. Maybe they want me to \nsearch the web for available documents, but that's a different approach than \nchecking a local system.\n\nFacts to Derive: Without knowing the exact source or type of documents, I can't \nderive anything yet. The answer depends on where to look and what kind of \ndocuments they need. So the next step is to ask the user for more details. \n\nIn the Plan, I should outline steps to clarify the user's request. First, ask \nthem to specify the context or source of the documents. Then, based on their \nresponse, decide whether to use the research agent for web searches or the RAG \nagent for knowledge base queries. If they provide a specific location, like a \nwebsite or database, I can proceed accordingly. Otherwise, I can't move forward \nwithout more information.\n\nSo the main action here is to request clarification from the user. That's the \nonly way to proceed because the current question is too vague. I can't assume \nthey mean public documents or a specific site. Each possibility requires a \ndifferent approach, so getting more details is essential.\n</think>\n\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task\n- The task is \"What documents are available?\" with no additional context or \nsources provided.\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\n- **Clarification on the scope of \"documents\"**: Need to determine if the user \nrefers to public documents, internal files, academic papers, legal records, or \nanother category.  \n- **Specific source or location**: Need to identify if the documents are hosted \non a particular website, database, or system (e.g., \"government archives,\" \n\"company intranet,\" \"academic repositories\").  \n- **Access permissions**: Determine if the user has access to restricted systems\nor requires authentication to retrieve documents.  \n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\n- Logical conclusion: Without clarification on the scope, source, or access \nrequirements, the task cannot be resolved. The answer depends on resolving \nambiguities in the question first.\n\n---\n\n1. Use `simple_chat` to request clarification from the user:  \n   - Ask whether they refer to public, private, academic, or another type of \ndocument.  \n   - Ask for the specific source or system where the documents are stored.  \n2. Based on the user\u2019s response, determine if the task requires:  \n   - A web search (use `research_agent`).  \n   - A query of a structured knowledge base (use `rag_agent`).  \n   - Access to internal systems (request credentials or permissions).  \n3. Execute the appropriate agent or action based on clarified requirements.  \n4.

The task is straightforward, just a  \nquestion about the current weather. There's no specific location mentioned, so  \nthat's a problem. Wait, the user didn't specify a location. That's an issue     \nbecause weather varies by place. So maybe I need to ask for the location. But   \nthe user might expect me to use their default location or assume a specific one.\nHmm, but without knowing the location, I can't proceed. So that's a fact I need \nto look up or derive. Wait, maybe the user is expecting me to use their current \nlocation if they're using a device that can detect it. But since I don't have   \naccess to that, I need to ask for the location. So the missing fact here is the \nlocation.                                                                       \n\nSo under Facts to look up, I need to get the current weather data. But to do    \nthat, I need the location. So maybe the first step is to determine the location.\nBut how? If the user hasn't provided it, I can't proceed without it. So perhaps \nthe first step is to ask the user for the location. But the user might not be   \nhere to respond. Wait, the task is to answer the question using the tools       \nprovided. The tools available are simple_chat, final_answer, research_agent, and\nrag_agent.                                                                      \n\nWait, the research_agent can perform web searches. So maybe I can use the       \nresearch_agent to look up the current weather. But to do that, I need to know   \nthe location. So the missing fact is the location. Therefore, I need to ask the \nuser for the location. But since the user is the one asking the question, maybe \nthey expect me to use their location. However, without access to geolocation    \ndata, I can't do that. So the correct approach is to inform the user that I need\nthe location to proceed. But the user might not be able to provide it. Hmm.     \n\nWait, the task is to answer the question using the tools. So perhaps the        \nresearch_agent can infer the location based on some other information. But how? \nIf the user hasn't specified the location, maybe the research_agent can use the \nIP address or something else. But I don't have access to that. So the correct   \nstep is to use the simple_chat function to ask the user for the location. But   \nthe user is the one who asked the question, so maybe they are expecting me to   \nproceed without it. Alternatively, maybe the research_agent can look up the     \ncurrent weather for a default location. But the problem is that the user didn't \nspecify, so that's an assumption.                                               \n\nSo, in the facts survey, under Facts to look up, I need to note that the        \nlocation is missing. Then, under Facts to derive, perhaps I can derive the      \nlocation from the user's context. But since I don't have access to that, I      \ncan't. Therefore, the plan is to first ask the user for the location using the  \nsimple_chat function, then use the research_agent to get the weather for that   \nlocation.                                                                       \n\nWait, but the user might not be able to respond. So maybe the research_agent can\nuse the current date and location based on the system's time zone. But that's an\nassumption. For example, if the system is set to a specific location, but the   \nuser might be in a different place. So that's not reliable.                     \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to first determine the location. Since the   \nuser hasn't provided it, the next step is to ask for it. So in the plan, the    \nfirst step is to use simple_chat to ask the user for the location. Then, once   \nthe location is known, use the research_agent to fetch the current weather for  \nthat                                                                            \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Initial plan \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nHere are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the\ntask:\n```\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this task. The user is asking, \"What's the weather today?\" So\nfirst, I need to figure out what facts I have and what I need to look up.\n\nStarting with the facts given in the task. The task is straightforward, just a \nquestion about the current weather. There's no specific location mentioned, so \nthat's a problem. Wait, the user didn't specify a location. That's an issue \nbecause weather varies by place. So maybe I need to ask for the location. But \nthe user might expect me to use their default location or assume a specific one.\nHmm, but without knowing the location, I can't proceed. So that's a fact I need \nto look up or derive. Wait, maybe the user is expecting me to use their current \nlocation if they're using a device that can detect it. But since I don't have \naccess to that, I need to ask for the location. So the missing fact here is the \nlocation. \n\nSo under Facts to look up, I need to get the current weather data. But to do \nthat, I need the location. So maybe the first step is to determine the location.\nBut how? If the user hasn't provided it, I can't proceed without it. So perhaps \nthe first step is to ask the user for the location. But the user might not be \nhere to respond. Wait, the task is to answer the question using the tools \nprovided. The tools available are simple_chat, final_answer, research_agent, and\nrag_agent. \n\nWait, the research_agent can perform web searches. So maybe I can use the \nresearch_agent to look up the current weather. But to do that, I need to know \nthe location. So the missing fact is the location. Therefore, I need to ask the \nuser for the location. But since the user is the one asking the question, maybe \nthey expect me to use their location. However, without access to geolocation \ndata, I can't do that. So the correct approach is to inform the user that I need\nthe location to proceed. But the user might not be able to provide it. Hmm. \n\nWait, the task is to answer the question using the tools. So perhaps the \nresearch_agent can infer the location based on some other information. But how? \nIf the user hasn't specified the location, maybe the research_agent can use the \nIP address or something else. But I don't have access to that. So the correct \nstep is to use the simple_chat function to ask the user for the location. But \nthe user is the one who asked the question, so maybe they are expecting me to \nproceed without it. Alternatively, maybe the research_agent can look up the \ncurrent weather for a default location. But the problem is that the user didn't \nspecify, so that's an assumption. \n\nSo, in the facts survey, under Facts to look up, I need to note that the \nlocation is missing. Then, under Facts to derive, perhaps I can derive the \nlocation from the user's context. But since I don't have access to that, I \ncan't. Therefore, the plan is to first ask the user for the location using the \nsimple_chat function, then use the research_agent to get the weather for that \nlocation. \n\nWait, but the user might not be able to respond. So maybe the research_agent can\nuse the current date and location based on the system's time zone. But that's an\nassumption. For example, if the system is set to a specific location, but the \nuser might be in a different place. So that's not reliable. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to first determine the location. Since the \nuser hasn't provided it, the next step is to ask for it. So in the plan, the \nfirst step is to use simple_chat to ask the user for the location. Then, once \nthe location is known, use the research_agent to fetch the current weather for \nthat\n```\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 Step 1 \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n{\"code\":\"location = simple_chat(message=\"Please provide the city or location for\nwhich you want the weather information.\")\\nprint(location)\",\"thought\":\"The user \nasked for the weather but didn't specify a location.

The task itself is straightforward, but I should\ncheck if there are any specific requirements mentioned. The user just said      \n\"Write a Python hello world,\" so there's no additional context provided. That   \nmeans the facts given in the task are minimal.                                  \n\nUnder 1.1, Facts given in the task, I should list what's provided. The main fact\nis the task statement itself. There's no other information given, like specific \nlibraries to use or output formats.                                             \n\nFor 1.2, Facts to look up, maybe I need to confirm the standard way to write    \nhello world in Python. But wait, I already know that it's usually done with     \nprint(\"Hello, World!\"). However, to be thorough, perhaps I should check if there\nare any common variations. But since the user didn't specify any constraints,   \nthe standard approach is safe. However, since the user might expect the most    \nbasic version, I don't need to look up anything else.                           \n\nIn 1.3, Facts to derive, the only thing to derive is the correct syntax for the \nprint statement in Python. Since Python 3 uses print() as a function, that's    \nstraightforward. No complex reasoning needed here.                              \n\nNow, moving to the plan. The plan should outline the steps to create the hello  \nworld program. The first step is to write the code, which is simple. Then, test \nit to ensure it runs without errors. Since the task is so basic, the plan is    \nminimal.                                                                        \n\nWait, but do I need to use any tools here? The user provided tools like         \nsimple_chat and final_answer. Since the answer is a code snippet, I can use     \nfinal_answer to present it. Also, maybe use simple_chat for any explanations,   \nbut the task just needs the code.                                               \n\nSo the plan would be: write the code, then output it using final_answer. No need\nfor research agents here because the solution is well-known.                    \n\nLet me double-check. Are there any edge cases? Like different Python versions?  \nProbably not necessary for a hello world. The user didn't specify, so stick with\nthe standard.                                                                   \n\n\nTherefore, the final answer is just the print statement. The plan is to generate\nthat code and present it.                                                       \n\n                          1.1. Facts given in the task                          \n\n \u2022 The task is to \"Write a Python hello world.\"                                 \n \u2022 No specific constraints or additional requirements are mentioned.            \n\n                             1.2.

The user wants me to write a Python hello world \nprogram. Hmm, first, I need to make sure I understand what exactly they're \nasking for. A \"hello world\" is typically a simple program that prints \"Hello, \nWorld!\" to the console. But maybe they want it in a specific format or with \ncertain elements?\n\nStarting with the facts survey. The task itself is straightforward, but I should\ncheck if there are any specific requirements mentioned. The user just said \n\"Write a Python hello world,\" so there's no additional context provided. That \nmeans the facts given in the task are minimal. \n\nUnder 1.1, Facts given in the task, I should list what's provided. The main fact\nis the task statement itself. There's no other information given, like specific \nlibraries to use or output formats. \n\nFor 1.2, Facts to look up, maybe I need to confirm the standard way to write \nhello world in Python. But wait, I already know that it's usually done with \nprint(\"Hello, World!\"). However, to be thorough, perhaps I should check if there\nare any common variations. But since the user didn't specify any constraints, \nthe standard approach is safe. However, since the user might expect the most \nbasic version, I don't need to look up anything else. \n\nIn 1.3, Facts to derive, the only thing to derive is the correct syntax for the \nprint statement in Python. Since Python 3 uses print() as a function, that's \nstraightforward. No complex reasoning needed here. \n\nNow, moving to the plan. The plan should outline the steps to create the hello \nworld program. The first step is to write the code, which is simple. Then, test \nit to ensure it runs without errors. Since the task is so basic, the plan is \nminimal. \n\nWait, but do I need to use any tools here? The user provided tools like \nsimple_chat and final_answer. Since the answer is a code snippet, I can use \nfinal_answer to present it. Also, maybe use simple_chat for any explanations, \nbut the task just needs the code. \n\nSo the plan would be: write the code, then output it using final_answer. No need\nfor research agents here because the solution is well-known. \n\nLet me double-check. Are there any edge cases? Like different Python versions? \nProbably not necessary for a hello world. The user didn't specify, so stick with\nthe standard. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is just the print statement. The plan is to generate\nthat code and present it.\n</think>\n\n### 1.1.

Since this team member is a real human, be as detailed and verbose as necessary in your task description.\\nYou can also include any relevant variables or context using the \\'additional_args\\' argument.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n```python\\ndef research_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Agent specialized in web search and current information research\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef rag_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Agent specialized in knowledge base search and complex reasoning\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n5. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\n8.

The user wants me to write a Python hello world program. Hmm, first, I need to make sure I understand what exactly they\\'re asking for. A \"hello world\" is typically a simple program that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console. But maybe they want it in a specific format or with certain elements?\\n\\nStarting with the facts survey. The task itself is straightforward, but I should check if there are any specific requirements mentioned. The user just said \"Write a Python hello world,\" so there\\'s no additional context provided. That means the facts given in the task are minimal. \\n\\nUnder 1.1, Facts given in the task, I should list what\\'s provided. The main fact is the task statement itself. There\\'s no other information given, like specific libraries to use or output formats. \\n\\nFor 1.2, Facts to look up, maybe I need to confirm the standard way to write hello world in Python. But wait, I already know that it\\'s usually done with print(\"Hello, World!\"). However, to be thorough, perhaps I should check if there are any common variations. But since the user didn\\'t specify any constraints, the standard approach is safe. However, since the user might expect the most basic version, I don\\'t need to look up anything else. \\n\\nIn 1.3, Facts to derive, the only thing to derive is the correct syntax for the print statement in Python. Since Python 3 uses print() as a function, that\\'s straightforward. No complex reasoning needed here. \\n\\nNow, moving to the plan. The plan should outline the steps to create the hello world program. The first step is to write the code, which is simple. Then, test it to ensure it runs without errors. Since the task is so basic, the plan is minimal. \\n\\nWait, but do I need to use any tools here? The user provided tools like simple_chat and final_answer. Since the answer is a code snippet, I can use final_answer to present it. Also, maybe use simple_chat for any explanations, but the task just needs the code. \\n\\nSo the plan would be: write the code, then output it using final_answer. No need for research agents here because the solution is well-known. \\n\\nLet me double-check. Are there any edge cases? Like different Python versions? Probably not necessary for a hello world. The user didn\\'t specify, so stick with the standard. \\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is just the print statement. The plan is to generate that code and present it.\\n</think>\\n\\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task\\n- The task is to \"Write a Python hello world.\"\\n- No specific constraints or additional requirements are mentioned.\\n\\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\\n- None. The standard Python \"hello world\" is a well-known concept and does not require external information.\\n\\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\\n- The correct syntax for printing \"Hello, World!\" in Python 3 is `print(\"Hello, World!\")`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2. Plan\\n1. Write a Python script that uses the `print` function to output \"Hello, World!\".\\n2. Validate the syntax to ensure it is compatible with Python 3.\\n3. Use `final_answer` to return the code as the solution.\\n\\n```'}], tool_calls=None, raw=None, token_usage=None), ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.USER: 'user'>, content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Now proceed and carry out this plan.'}], tool_calls=None, raw=None, token_usage=None)], 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_2', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'python_interpreter', 'arguments': 'print(\"Hello, World!\")\\nfinal_answer(\"print(\\\\\"Hello, World!\\\\\")\")'}}], 'error': None, 'model_output_message': {'role': <MessageRole.ASSISTANT: 'assistant'>, 'content': '{\"code\":\"print(\\\\\"Hello, World!\\\\\")\\\\nfinal_answer(\\\\\"print(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello, World!\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\")\",\"thought\":\"The task is to write a Python hello world program.

The task says \"Create a function to  \nadd numbers.\" So the main fact here is that the function's purpose is to add    \nnumbers. But what kind of numbers? Are we dealing with integers, floats, or     \nmaybe even complex numbers? The task doesn't specify, so that's something I need\nto clarify. Also, how many numbers should the function add? Should it handle two\nnumbers, or a variable number of arguments?                                     \n\nNext, facts to look up. Since the task is about writing a function in           \nprogramming, I might need to check the syntax for function definitions in a     \nspecific language. But the user hasn't mentioned a programming language. That's \nanother fact I need to determine. If they don't specify, maybe I should assume a\ncommon language like Python, but it's better to confirm. Also, are there any    \nconstraints or edge cases to consider, like negative numbers or handling        \nnon-numeric inputs? Those could be important for the function's robustness.     \n\nFacts to derive. Once I know the language and the requirements (number types,   \nquantity of numbers), I can derive the function's structure. For example, in    \nPython, a function to add two numbers would be simple, but if it needs to handle\nmultiple numbers, using *args would be necessary. Also, error handling might be \nrequired if the inputs aren't numbers. So deriving the correct parameters and   \nreturn type is part of this step.                                               \n\n\nNow, for the plan. First, I need to clarify the requirements by asking the user \nabout the programming language, the number of arguments, and the types of       \nnumbers. Then, based on their answers, I can outline the function's parameters  \nand logic. If they want a basic function without error handling, it's           \nstraightforward. If they need it to handle various cases, I'll have to add      \nchecks. Finally, I'll present the code and test it with examples to ensure it   \nworks as intended.                                                              \n\n                          1.1.

The user wants me to create a function to add \nnumbers. Hmm, first I need to understand exactly what they're asking for. The \ntask is pretty straightforward, but maybe there are some nuances I should \nconsider.\n\nStarting with the facts given in the task. The task says \"Create a function to \nadd numbers.\" So the main fact here is that the function's purpose is to add \nnumbers. But what kind of numbers? Are we dealing with integers, floats, or \nmaybe even complex numbers? The task doesn't specify, so that's something I need\nto clarify. Also, how many numbers should the function add? Should it handle two\nnumbers, or a variable number of arguments?\n\nNext, facts to look up. Since the task is about writing a function in \nprogramming, I might need to check the syntax for function definitions in a \nspecific language. But the user hasn't mentioned a programming language. That's \nanother fact I need to determine. If they don't specify, maybe I should assume a\ncommon language like Python, but it's better to confirm. Also, are there any \nconstraints or edge cases to consider, like negative numbers or handling \nnon-numeric inputs? Those could be important for the function's robustness.\n\nFacts to derive. Once I know the language and the requirements (number types, \nquantity of numbers), I can derive the function's structure. For example, in \nPython, a function to add two numbers would be simple, but if it needs to handle\nmultiple numbers, using *args would be necessary. Also, error handling might be \nrequired if the inputs aren't numbers. So deriving the correct parameters and \nreturn type is part of this step.\n\nNow, for the plan. First, I need to clarify the requirements by asking the user \nabout the programming language, the number of arguments, and the types of \nnumbers. Then, based on their answers, I can outline the function's parameters \nand logic. If they want a basic function without error handling, it's \nstraightforward. If they need it to handle various cases, I'll have to add \nchecks. Finally, I'll present the code and test it with examples to ensure it \nworks as intended.\n</think>\n\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task\n- The task is to \"Create a function to add numbers.\"\n- No specific programming language is mentioned.\n- No constraints on input types (e.g., integers, floats, variable count of \nnumbers).\n\n---\n\n### 1.2.

Facts to derive\n1. **Function signature**: Once the language and input requirements are known, \nderive the correct syntax for the function (e.g., `def add(a, b)` in Python vs. \n`function add(a, b)` in JavaScript).\n2. **Error handling logic**: If edge cases are confirmed, derive validation \nsteps (e.g., type checks, range checks).\n3. **Return type**: Determine if the output should be an integer, float, or \nmatch the input type dynamically.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Plan\n1. Use `simple_chat` to ask the user to specify the programming language for the\nfunction.\n2.

So maybe I should list what's missing.\nThe facts to look up would include the required programming language and the    \nspecific sorting algorithm. But how do I get that info? Since the user didn't   \nprovide it, maybe I should ask for clarification. But the tools available       \ninclude simple_chat, which can handle basic questions.

But since the user hasn't provided those details\nyet, maybe the first step is to use the simple_chat function to ask for         \nclarification on the language and algorithm.

The user wants me to generate code for sorting. \nHmm, first I need to figure out what exactly they need. The task is pretty \nvague. Are they looking for a specific sorting algorithm? Like bubble sort, \nquicksort, or maybe a built-in method? Also, what programming language? The \nexample tools mention Python functions, so maybe Python is the target.\n\nIn the facts given, there's nothing specific. The user just said \"Generate code \nfor sorting.\" So I need to make some assumptions here. But wait, the \ninstructions say not to make assumptions. So maybe I should list what's missing.\nThe facts to look up would include the required programming language and the \nspecific sorting algorithm. But how do I get that info? Since the user didn't \nprovide it, maybe I should ask for clarification. But the tools available \ninclude simple_chat, which can handle basic questions. So perhaps I should use \nthat to ask the user for more details.\n\nWait, the user might expect a general example. Maybe the most common approach is\nto provide a Python example using the built-in sort method or a common algorithm\nlike quicksort. But without knowing, I should note that as a fact to derive. The\nderived fact would be the choice of algorithm and language based on standard \npractices.\n\nSo the plan would involve first determining the necessary details by asking the \nuser, then generating the code. But since the user hasn't provided those details\nyet, maybe the first step is to use the simple_chat function to ask for \nclarification on the language and algorithm. Then, once those are known, proceed\nto write the code. Alternatively, if no response is received, default to a \ncommon choice, but the instructions say not to make assumptions. So the safest \napproach is to request the missing information first.\n</think>\n\n### 1.1. Facts given in the task\n- The task is to \"Generate code for sorting.\"\n- No specific programming language, sorting algorithm, or input format is \nspecified.\n\n### 1.2. Facts to look up\n- **Required programming language**: Need to determine the target language \n(e.g., Python, JavaScript) since sorting implementations vary by language.  \n  *Where to find*: Clarify with the user via `simple_chat` or infer from context\n(e.g., if the task mentions a language).  \n- **Sorting algorithm**: Need to confirm the desired algorithm (e.g., quicksort,\nmergesort, built-in `sort()`).  \n  *Where to find*: Clarify with the user via `simple_chat` or infer from common \nuse cases.  \n- **Input/output format**: Need to know if the input is a list, array, custom \nobject, etc., and if stability or in-place sorting is required.  \n  *Where to find*: Clarify with the user via `simple_chat`.\n\n### 1.3. Facts to derive\n- **Default assumptions**: If no clarification is received, derive a standard \nsolution (e.g., Python\u2019s built-in `sorted()` for simplicity).  \n  *Reasoning*: Python is a common default language, and built-in methods are \nefficient and concise.  \n- **Edge cases**: Derive handling of edge cases (e.g., empty lists, non-numeric \ndata) based on the chosen algorithm and language.  \n  *Reasoning*: Robust code must account for invalid inputs or unexpected data \ntypes.\n\n---\n\n1. Use `simple_chat` to ask the user to specify the programming language, \nsorting algorithm, and input/output requirements.  \n2. If the user provides no additional details, assume Python and use the \nbuilt-in `sorted()` function as the default solution.  \n3. Generate the code snippet based on the derived assumptions, ensuring it \nincludes comments explaining the approach.  \n4. Validate the code for syntax and edge cases (e.g., empty lists, mixed data \ntypes).  \n5. Use `final_answer` to return the generated code.  \n\n```\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 Step 1 \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n{\"code\":\"# Example of sorting a list in Python\\nnumbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5,       \n9]\\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)  # Returns a new sorted                    \nlist\\nprint(sorted_numbers)\\n\\n# For in-place sorting:\\nnumbers.sort()  #       \nModifies the original list\\nprint(numbers)\",\"thought\":\"Since the task does not  \nspecify a programming language, sorting algorithm, or input format, I will      \ngenerate a simple Python example using the built-in sorted() function, which is \nefficient and widely used for general sorting tasks.\"}                           \u2500 Executing parsed code: \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  # Example of sorting a list in Python                                         \n  numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]                                                  \n  sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)  # Returns a new sorted list                 \n  print(sorted_numbers)                                                         \n                                                                                \n  # For in-place sorting:                                                       \n  numbers.sort()  # Modifies the original list                                  \n  print(numbers)                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \nExecution logs:\n[1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]\n[1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]\n\nOut: None\n[Step 1: Duration 1.60 seconds| Input tokens: 2,896 | Output tokens: 121]\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 Step 2 \u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\n\u001b[1;31mGive Feedback / Get Help: https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/new\u001b[0m\nLiteLLM.Info: If you need to debug this error, use `litellm._turn_on_debug()'.\n\n\n\u001b[1;31mProvider List: https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers\u001b[0m\n\nError in generating model output:\nlitellm.BadRequestError: GroqException - {\"error\":{\"message\":\"Failed to call a \nfunction.
