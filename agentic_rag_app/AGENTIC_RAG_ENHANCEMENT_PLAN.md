# Agentic RAG Enhancement Plan

## Current System Assessment
Your system shows a solid foundation with:
- **Good**: Multi-agent architecture (Orchestrator, Retrieval, Reasoning, Refinement)
- **Good**: Rich document processing pipeline with Docling
- **Good**: ReAct agent implementation with reasoning tools
- **Missing**: Advanced query planning, evaluation loops, dynamic retrieval strategies

## Key Improvements from LlamaIndex Patterns

### 1. **Enhanced Query Planning & Routing**
- Add query classification to route different question types to specialized agents
- Implement sub-query generation for complex multi-part questions
- Add query rewriting based on retrieval feedback

### 2. **Dynamic Retrieval Strategies**
- Implement adaptive similarity thresholds based on query complexity
- Add hierarchical retrieval (document → section → chunk)
- Include temporal/recency scoring for time-sensitive queries

### 3. **Advanced Agent Orchestration**
- Add a **Critique Agent** that evaluates responses before returning
- Implement **Planning Agent** for multi-step reasoning workflows
- Add **Memory Agent** for conversation context and user preferences

### 4. **Evaluation & Feedback Loops**
- Add automated response quality scoring
- Implement user feedback integration for continuous improvement
- Add retrieval relevance evaluation with re-ranking

### 5. **Multi-Modal Enhancement**
- Extend image processing beyond OCR to visual reasoning
- Add chart/graph interpretation capabilities
- Implement cross-modal retrieval (text queries → visual results)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Advanced Query Planning (Week 1-2)
- Add QueryPlannerAgent for complex query decomposition
- Implement query classification and routing logic
- Add sub-query generation and coordination

### Phase 2: Dynamic Retrieval System (Week 2-3)
- Enhance retrieval with adaptive similarity thresholds
- Add hierarchical document → section → chunk retrieval
- Implement hybrid search (semantic + keyword + temporal)

### Phase 3: Agent Orchestration Improvements (Week 3-4)
- Add CritiqueAgent for response evaluation
- Enhance memory system with user preferences
- Implement conversation-aware context management

### Phase 4: Evaluation & Feedback Integration (Week 4-5)
- Add automated response quality metrics
- Implement user feedback collection and learning
- Add retrieval relevance evaluation with re-ranking

### Phase 5: Multi-Modal Enhancements (Week 5-6)
- Extend visual reasoning capabilities beyond OCR
- Add chart/graph interpretation agents
- Implement cross-modal retrieval and reasoning

## Notes
The plan focuses on incrementally enhancing your existing solid foundation with proven LlamaIndex patterns while maintaining backward compatibility.
